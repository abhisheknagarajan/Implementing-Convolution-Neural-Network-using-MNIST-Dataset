# Implementing-Convolution-Neural-Network-using-MNIST-Dataset

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

he MNIST dataset contains 60,000 images of handwritten digits (zero to nine) that have been size-normalized and centered in a square grid of pixels. Each image is a 28 × 28 × 1 array of floating-point numbers representing grayscale intensities ranging from 0 (black) to 1 (white). The target data consists of one-hot binary vectors of size 10, corresponding to the digit classification categories zero through nine.
